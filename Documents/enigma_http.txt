enigma serial access
--------------------

basically, serial it's the same thing as you would connect to port 80 via network -
it's HTTP, and you should be able to do all things you want to do using http.

However, as we don't have a defined "start" condition (like connection establishing
when using tcp), we define the "break condition" as a defined start.

(FYI: a "break condition" is a special out-of-bound serial character where the
TX-line is set to 0 for a longer time than a character. Most terminal-programs
should be able to send a break condition, in minicom for example you can press
"Ctrl+A" "F".)

After that, you issue the HTTP-request ("GET /... HTTP/1.0"), followed by a '\n'.
Yes, that's NEWLINE, opposed to the usual Carriage Return used in terminals.

(Sorry for that, but everything else would involve a modification on the input,
and thus, the transmission wouldn't be 8bit clean. I didn't like that.)

NOTE: enigma's serial access is most propably not yet enabled in your image, as
it was committed to cvs at 03/04/17, but there will be a new image with this
feature soon. but as said - it's like network access, just over serial port.

enigma network access
---------------------

well, just usual HTTP on port 80 - nothing special. HTTP/1.1 persistent connections
are not (yet) supported.

enigma HTTP access
------------------
basically, look into src/enigma_dyn.cpp and src/enigma_web.cpp to see the commands
defined there. as the webfrontend sucks (i'm still searching for somebody with
XSLT knowledge who can design websites!), there is lot of stuff here i won't
explain.

the important things might be:

GET /cgi-bin/xmessage?timeout=<seconds>&caption=<caption>&body=<body>[&type=<nr>]
(for sending an on-screen message, type is optional. messageboxes with same type
 override each other, allowing you to display some progress texts or something
 like this)
GET /cgi-bin/reloadSettings
GET /cgi-bin/reloadRecordings
GET /cgi-bin/saveRecordings
GET /cgi-bin/reloadPlaylist
GET /cgi-bin/savePlaylist
GET /cgi-bin/reloadUserBouquets
GET /cgi-bin/saveUserBouquets
GET /cgi-bin/reloadTimerList
GET /cgi-bin/saveTimerList
GET /cgi-bin/startPlugin?name=<name>[&path=<path>]
[GET|PUT] /config/enigma/services (or any other file)
[GET|PUT] /root/proc/... (or any other file)

Some actions may require authentication, in this case the realm is "dreambox",
and valid username/passwords are these from the unix system, i.e. "root" and 
"dreambox".



sooo, if you want to upload new channellists, issue a "PUT" to 
"/config/enigma/services", and a "GET /cgi-bin/reloadSettings" (etc.)

if there are any questions, <felix@dream-multimedia-tv.de> will be there for you :)
