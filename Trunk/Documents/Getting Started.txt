To set-up your development enviroment you need the following configuration.

- Delphi 7.0 Build 8.1;
- Indy 10 instead of the standard components that come with Delphi 7;

The version of Indy that is used here is located in the folder [root]\3rthparty\components. The installation will guide you through the process of uninstalling your current Indy version before installing the new one.

When opening the application for the first time, open the LW.dpk package first and install it.

That's all there is to it.
